# Interactive Guessing Game
In this assignment you will write a Python program that plays an interactive guessing game with the user:

1. Your program will generate a random integer in the range 1 to 10
2. The user will receive three guesses to determine the integer.
3. After each guess your program will inform the user whether the guess was correct, too high, or too low.
4. If the user does not guess the number correct within 3 tries, the program will print the correct answer
